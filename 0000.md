## Prelude

You've been tailing them for days now. The pair of them. Faces hidden, deep in their strangely-cut black cloaks. If they've ever noticed you, they've given no sign. Still, you take care, always maintaining discipline. Tracking people is one thing, long after they've passed. But actively tailing is another. You're not always behind, lurking in the shadows. Sometimes you sprint through shortcuts to get ahead to a vantage point, where you can remain hidden while seeing which fork they take. Sometimes you stalk through the night into their camp to search their belongings, hoping for some clue about their destination or motivations. It's been thoroughly exhausting and you're no closer to any answers.

It was just along the Triboar Trail when you lost them. Did they continue west to the High Road? Or turn south, towards Phandalin? Less than an hour of daylight left. Their supplies were quite low, last you checked...

Without breaking stride, your instincts steer you south.
