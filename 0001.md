## Phandalin

Astra continues to walk among the log buildings, taking care to watch the weight of her footsteps, especially in the muddy parts. The sun dips and softens as she reaches the town square, which empties steadily as townsfolk return to their homes.

On the square, there is only one inn, which shines brightly. Near it, some small temple of sorts. To the south, a merchant is closing shop for the day, and the well-signed Townmaster's Hall has already done so. There are roads leading in every direction from the square, most of which appear to lead to homes or into the hills. In the distance to the east, a rotting old manor dominates a low hillside.

The mysterious pair are nowhere to be seen.
